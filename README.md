# Warmindo Menu Management🍝
This project was my final exam as a freshman. It manages food and beverage menus for a Warmindo, reading from a file called `warmindo.txt` to display items for users to browse. Users can easily add or remove items directly through the program, making menu updates simple and flexible!

# How To Use 📌
1. Download the `Warmindo.cpp` file along with `menu.txt` and `sementara.txt`.
2. Run `Warmindo.cpp` and enter the program password: `uta`.
3. That's all! You can now view, edit, add, or remove menu items as needed.
